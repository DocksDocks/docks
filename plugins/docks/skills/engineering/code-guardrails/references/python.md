# Python guardrails

## Detect

- Check `pyproject.toml` for `[tool.ruff]` and `[tool.ruff.lint]`.
- Check `ruff.toml` and `.ruff.toml` for `[lint]`.
- Check `pyproject.toml` for `[tool.mypy]` or `[tool.pyright]`.
- Check `pyrightconfig.json` and existing mypy configuration before selecting a type checker.
- Ask before installing Ruff or a type checker if the project does not have one.

## Recommended config

Merge these entries into the existing `pyproject.toml`; do not replace its settings. Keep existing rule selections and add missing prefixes to `extend-select`. If `extend-select` exists, append missing prefixes to its list. Keep any stricter settings. Preserve other entries in `per-file-ignores`; add only the test patterns that match the project. The mypy section applies only when the project uses mypy.

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
extend-select = ["E", "F", "B", "UP", "SIM", "PL", "RUF", "ERA", "T20", "ANN"]

[tool.ruff.lint.pylint]
allow-magic-value-types = []

[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]
"**/tests/**/*.py" = ["PLR2004"]
"**/test_*.py" = ["PLR2004"]

[tool.mypy]
strict = true
```

`select` replaces the default rule set; `extend-select` adds to it. Keep an existing `select` list instead of replacing it. Ruff omits `[tool.ruff]` prefixes in `ruff.toml` and `.ruff.toml`. With an existing Pyright setup, use `typeCheckingMode = "strict"` in `[tool.pyright]` or `pyrightconfig.json` instead of adding mypy. Do not install an absent checker without asking. Report each new prefix and setting to the user.

## Rules that catch raw values

| Rule | Catches | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PLR2004` | Unnamed numerical constants in comparisons. | Comparisons only; it does not find repeated values in assignments, calls, paths, keys, or units. |

Ruff exempts common comparison values such as `0`, `1`, and `""`. The `allow-magic-value-types = []` setting removes type-based exemptions, including the default string and bytes exemptions; it does not remove the rule's common-value exemptions. Use `SKILL.md` § **Find scattered values** for values beyond comparison checks. The test-file exception permits literal expected values when a test checks a constant itself; use production constants for test inputs. Do not disable other rules in test files.

## Constant map

Define module-level `typing.Final` constants in one owning module per domain. Derive related values from the owning constants. Include units in names, such as `MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES`. Use `enum.StrEnum` or `enum.IntEnum` for closed string or integer sets when the project's Python version supports them. Import constants and enum members from their owning module instead of copying values.

```python
# BAD — repeated size and state literals drift across consumers.
def accept_upload(payload_bytes: int, state: str) -> bool:
    return payload_bytes <= 8388608 and state == "ready"

# In another module:
def queued_upload(payload_bytes: int, state: str) -> bool:
    return payload_bytes <= 8388608 and state == "ready"

# GOOD — upload_limits.py owns domain values and derives the size limit.
from enum import StrEnum
from typing import Final

KIB_BYTES: Final = 1024
MIB_BYTES: Final = 1024 * KIB_BYTES
MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES: Final = 8 * MIB_BYTES

class UploadState(StrEnum):
    READY = "ready"

# GOOD — consumers import one mapped source instead of copying literals.
from upload_limits import MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES, UploadState

def accept_upload(payload_bytes: int, state: UploadState) -> bool:
    return payload_bytes <= MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES and state is UploadState.READY
```

For tests, pass `MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` as an input. When the test checks the constant's value, compare it with the literal expected value.

## Verify

Run `ruff check .` and the existing type checker: `mypy .` for mypy or `pyright` for Pyright. Review violations, then report the config changes and the remaining findings.
