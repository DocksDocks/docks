# Never Suppress Lint / Type Errors

<constraint>
Comments like `eslint-disable`, `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error`, `@ts-nocheck`, `// noqa`, `# type: ignore`, `# pylint: disable`, `@SuppressWarnings` are not fixes — they are hidden problems. They rot silently: the lint rule was added for a reason, and silencing it converts a one-time prompt into a permanent trap. Always fix the root cause.
</constraint>

## When to Use

- A linter or type-checker just flagged a line and the "obvious" fix is a suppression comment.
- Reviewing a diff that adds one of the suppression patterns.
- Setting up tooling for a new project — decide NOW that suppressions are blocked, not later.
- A React 19 `react-hooks/*`, TypeScript `strict`-mode, or ESLint `no-explicit-any` rule fires and feels "wrong."
- Porting legacy code that's full of suppressions.

## Decision Tree — Before Adding a Suppression

1. **Is the rule flagging a real anti-pattern?** Search the rule name + "how to fix." Check the framework's migration guide. Most rules have a documented idiomatic replacement.
2. **Is the code doing something the rule author didn't anticipate?** 99% of the time, no. The rule's edge cases are usually already covered.
3. **Is there a structural fix?** Often yes: extract a function, change a type, narrow a type guard, introduce a derived value, move logic to a different scope.
4. **Only if all three fail**: document the concrete, irreducible reason (hardware quirk, third-party type declaration bug with a filed issue link, platform constraint) in the comment *and* the PR description. "Speed" / "later" / "I'll fix it next sprint" are not reasons.

## Common Traps — Fix Instead of Suppress

| Rule | Wrong fix | Right fix |
|---|---|---|
| `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` | `// eslint-disable-next-line` | Move setState into an async callback, derive state instead, or use `useSyncExternalStore` |
| `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` | Disable the rule for "stable" refs | Put the ref in the array, memoize the value, or hoist the computation |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` | `// @ts-ignore` or cast through `unknown` | Write the real type; if external, declare a narrow interface |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` | Prefix with `_` then suppress | Actually remove the variable, or wire it into the logic |
| TypeScript `TS2322` type mismatch | `@ts-expect-error` | Fix the type — either the source or the consumer |
| Python `# noqa: E501` | Suppress the line-length rule | Split the line, or configure the project's line-length globally |
| `no-console` | Disable per-line | Use the project logger, or gate behind `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` |

## When to Load References

| Triggered by | Reference file |
|---|---|
| Setting up the pre-commit hook (or its CI mirror) that blocks new suppressions | `references/pre-commit-hook.md` |
| Looking up suppression syntax / scope rules for a specific tool (ESLint, TypeScript, mypy, ruff, clippy, golangci-lint, shellcheck, pylint, Java) | `references/per-tool-catalog.md` |

<constraint>
Project-level rule-disabling (turning off a rule repo-wide via `.eslintrc` / `tsconfig.json` / `pyproject.toml`) is the same problem as inline suppression — just at a wider blast radius. Scope rule-disabling to the minimum file pattern that genuinely needs it (e.g., auto-generated files, vendored code), and document the reason in the config.
</constraint>

<constraint>
CI must enforce the suppression block too. Client-side hooks are bypassable with `--no-verify`. Run the same scanner as a CI job so PRs cannot land with new suppressions even if the committer skipped the local hook. See `references/pre-commit-hook.md` § CI Mirror for a ready-to-paste GitHub Actions step.
</constraint>

## Gotchas

- **"It's legacy code" ≠ license to suppress.** If you're touching the line, fix it. If you're not, leave the pre-existing suppression untouched (the staged-diff scanner does the right thing — it only blocks NEW suppressions).
- **`// TODO: fix this lint error`** is also a smell. If you can write the TODO comment, you can write the real fix.
- **`@ts-ignore` vs `@ts-expect-error`** — prefer `@ts-expect-error` when a suppression is truly justified. TS will warn if the underlying error goes away (forcing removal), so the suppression can't drift silently.
