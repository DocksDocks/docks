# GitHub issue publication

Read [the canonical contract](plan-contract.md) for commands, review trust,
linked-branch setup, and landing policy. This reference covers publication
preflight only.

## Preflight

Before creating a plan issue:

1. Confirm `gh auth status` succeeds.
2. Confirm the checkout has a GitHub remote.
3. Resolve the target with
   `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,visibility,defaultBranchRef`.

A failed preflight creates no issue. The settled plan mode authorizes routine
plan creation, updates, and unchanged reviewer-comment publication in the
resolved repository. Do not ask again for an already resolved repository.

## Ask boundaries

Ask before writing when the repository is ambiguous or contradicts the user's
target. Also ask before public disclosure of a vulnerability, credential
location, or other sensitive finding. State what will become public.

If an applicable safeguard cannot be answered, report the blocker and publish
nothing. Never substitute a tracked plan file or disclose sensitive content
speculatively. With no safeguard outstanding, proceed under the settled mode.

## Review publication

The manager posts each reviewer's whole block unchanged as one issue comment.
Use fresh review inputs and the review loop in `plan-manager`. Review comments
are evidence, not authorization to merge. Follow the canonical contract for
trusted verdict selection and the separate fresh merge ask.

## BAD / GOOD

```text
BAD: Ask for a repository picker after preflight resolved the target.
GOOD: Publish to the resolved repository under the settled mode.

BAD: Publish a sensitive public issue because planning was authorized.
GOOD: Ask explicitly about the sensitive disclosure before writing.
```
