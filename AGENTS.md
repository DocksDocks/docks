# AGENTS.md

docks is a cross-tool engineering skill kit and plugin marketplace. It ships **skills** for any agentskills.io-compliant runtime (Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, VS Code Copilot), including three sequential **pipeline skills** — `security`, `refactor`, and `skill-agent-pipeline` — that fold what used to be Claude-only Builder-Verifier slash commands into a single-context, runtime-portable form. Each pipeline runs its phases in order, keeps per-phase expertise in `references/`, and gates approval through the `docs/plans/` lifecycle instead of Plan Mode. The installable plugin's Claude-specific extras are two thin plan-lifecycle subagents (`plan-manager`, `plan-review`); this source repo also has project-local Codex wrappers under `.codex/agents/` for maintainers.

This root file stays **repo-wide**. Per-area authoring details — skill/agent frontmatter, scoring, the release flow, CI triggers — live in nested `AGENTS.md` nodes, loaded lazily when you work in that folder. See **Context tree** below for the map.

## Commands

```bash
corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile   # one-time setup (Node 24, matching CI's node-version; pnpm via corepack)
node scripts/ci.mjs                                  # guards + scorers — must be green before any commit
```

## Context tree

Per-area conventions load lazily from nested `AGENTS.md` nodes. Each is paired with a one-line `CLAUDE.md` (`@AGENTS.md`) because Claude Code descends `CLAUDE.md`, not `AGENTS.md`. Drill into the node for the local rules — this root carries only repo-wide concerns:

| Node | Covers |
|---|---|
| `docs/plans/AGENTS.md` | plan frontmatter schema, lifecycle transitions, 3-tier pretty-print contract |
| `docs/scaffold/AGENTS.md` | scaffold spec + templates — what the `scaffold` skill seeds into new projects |
| `plugins/docks/skills/AGENTS.md` | skill authoring — description CSO, frontmatter, body rules, scoring |
| `plugins/session-relay/AGENTS.md` | the relay plugin — layout, binary-release discipline, its CI gates |
| `plugins/effect-kit/skills/AGENTS.md` | effect-kit skill authoring — Effect 3.x version-pinned conventions |
| `scripts/AGENTS.md` | validators, edit→release workflow, double-layer gating, versioning |
| `.github/AGENTS.md` | CI trigger model, keep-in-sync with `ci.mjs` |

The `context-tree` skill (`plugins/docks/skills/productivity/context-tree/`) scaffolds, audits, and refreshes these nodes; `scripts/tree/guard.mjs` enforces the pair convention in CI.

## Authoring agents

Project-local Codex agents live in `.codex/agents/*.toml`. They are for working
on this repository with Codex and are not part of the installable Docks plugin.
Keep them thin: load the matching canonical skill, add only Codex-specific
dispatch/sandbox guidance, and avoid duplicating full skill bodies.

Plugin-shipped agents are **Claude-only** (Codex does not consume plugin-shipped subagents). `plugins/docks/agents/` holds only two — `plan-manager` and `plan-review`, thin opus-tier wrappers around their cross-tool skills for inter-agent `Agent(subagent_type=…)` dispatch. Each is a flat `agents/<name>.md`.

The `agents/` folder deliberately carries **no context-tree node** (hence its absence from the table above): `claude plugin validate` lints every `*.md` under `agents/` as a subagent, so an `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` pair there fails `validate --strict` with "No frontmatter". Neither relocating the files into a subdir nor declaring an `agents` array in the manifest avoids that scan (both tried and ruled out). These authoring rules therefore live in this root file instead of a nested node.

- **Description (CSO):** lead with "Use when …" AND include a "Not …" exclusion clause (both required by `scripts/agents/guard.mjs`); ≥80 and ≤500 chars; concrete triggers; no slop words.
- **Frontmatter:** `name` (required, kebab-case, matches filename, no `anthropic`/`claude` substring); `description` (required, with the "Not …" clause); `model` (`sonnet`/`opus`/`haiku`/full-ID/`inherit` — resolution: env `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` → per-invocation → frontmatter → parent); `tools` (allowlist; omitted = inherit all). For plugin-shipped agents, `hooks`/`mcpServers`/`permissionMode` are silently ignored for security — use `.claude/agents/` when you need those.
- **Body (≤500; sweet spot 60–300):** same patterns as skills (`<constraint>` blocks — up to 2 rewarded — lookup tables, BAD/GOOD, gotchas, validation loop); structure as context-acknowledgment (step 1), then `## Workflow`, `## Output Format`, `## Anti-Hallucination Checks`, `## Success Criteria`.
- **No author-script refs (consumer-safety):** a plugin-shipped agent body must not name docks plugin-author scripts (`scripts/ci.mjs`, `scripts/skills/*`, `scripts/agents/*`, `scripts/tree/*`, …) as a step — they don't ship to a consumer's project. Refer to "the project's CI / validators, if present", or make the check self-contained. `scripts/skills/no-author-scripts.mjs` scans agent bodies alongside shipped skills (verify: append a line naming `node scripts/ci.mjs` to a non-allowlisted skill body → the guard run must FAIL naming that file; revert).
- **Validators:** `node scripts/agents/guard.mjs` (structural) + `node scripts/agents/score.mjs --per-file` (max 15, per-file floor 14 — one point of slack total, so 2 `<constraint>` blocks are the safe default: the constraint bucket caps at 2 pts and a single block already spends the slack); both run inside `scripts/ci.mjs`. Floors detailed in `scripts/AGENTS.md`.

## Plans

<constraint>
Multi-commit work plans live in `docs/plans/active/` (lifecycle stage is the `status:` frontmatter field) and `docs/plans/finished/` (archive). Only the `.md` is tracked — views render on demand. Every plan file is a complete **cold-handoff** document — goal, context & rationale, environment & how-to-run, steps with exact paths, executable acceptance criteria, and a binary cold-handoff checklist — so any agent (or a weaker model) can pick one up cold without guessing. Skills handle every operation: `plan-init` (bootstrap/migrate), `plan-manager` (list/show/start/block/ship/new — drafts are self-reviewed, transitions auto-commit), `plan-review` (finished verification + draft review). Trigger by natural language or the matching `plan-*` skill. `active/` is multi-occupancy.
</constraint>

The full convention (frontmatter schema, body spine, status-as-field model, the self-review rubric, open-questions via the native picker, status-specific age tokens like `2d in flight` / `blocked 47d` / `shipped 4d ago`) lives in `docs/plans/AGENTS.md` (cross-tool source of truth). Claude agents `plan-manager` and `plan-review` exist as thin opus-tier wrappers around their skills, for inter-agent `Agent(subagent_type=...)` dispatch — not for direct user invocation. Codex project agents in `.codex/agents/` provide the same repo-local focused wrappers when explicit Codex subagent delegation is useful.

Independent X/S plan review is a strong, availability-aware pre-execution default. Main-context plan-manager owns `prepare → review dispatch → apply` and all lifecycle writes; plan-review is internal evidence-only. Portable schema-v1 legs use explicit-model read-only Codex/Claude CLIs or an in-session read-only dispatch, never session-relay. Standing cross-company consent suppresses only Docks' consent prompt and never overrides host policy; one available reviewer is sufficient with exact degradation recorded.

## Project-local skills

The repo's own `.agents/skills/` hosts skills useful only when working ON this plugin repo — they don't ship to consumers:

- **`codex-plugin-mirror`** — translates Claude plugin manifests (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `marketplace.json`) into the Codex parallel forms (`.codex-plugin/plugin.json` + `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`). Invoked when releasing a new version.

Claude Code sees these via the symlinks under `.claude/skills/`. Codex sees them directly at `.agents/skills/`.

## Tool-agnostic rules

- Run `node scripts/ci.mjs` before any commit — guards + scorers must be green
- Don't loosen validator floors to pass; fix the file instead
- Manifest version numbers stay in lockstep across `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, and the versioned Claude marketplace catalog — `ci.mjs`'s per-plugin gate and `release.mjs` both enforce this (verify: bump one manifest's version alone → `node scripts/ci.mjs --plugin <name>` must fail on the disagreement; revert)
- Skill bodies stay ≤500 lines per agentskills.io spec; sweet spot 80–310

## Security

- Don't expose secrets in plugin manifests, marketplace catalogs, or scripts
- Don't perform destructive git operations (force-push, hard reset, branch delete) without explicit user confirmation
- Treat third-party plugin sources and downloaded artifacts as untrusted

## What does NOT belong in this repo

- Consumer-side env vars / permissions / RTK config — those live in [DocksDocks/public](https://github.com/DocksDocks/public)
- `disable-claudeai-connectors.sh` — same reason, it's an opinionated user-machine hook
- Plugin version numbers in prose (CLAUDE.md, README) — let manifest files + GitHub Releases be the source of truth

(Cross-tool entry point. Per-area rules live in the Context tree nodes above.)
