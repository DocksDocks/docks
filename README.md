# docks

Claude Code plugin marketplace publishing the **docks** plugin — a multi-agent pipeline kit with 8 slash commands, 7 engineering-convention skills, and 41 specialized subagents (12 Opus + 29 Sonnet, tiered per phase).

## Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add DocksDocks/docks
/plugin install docks@docks
/reload-plugins
```

After install, commands are namespaced as `/docks:security`, `/docks:fix`, `/docks:review`, etc. Skills auto-trigger as before (they're `user-invocable: false`, namespacing is invisible at runtime).

## Repository layout

```
.
├── .claude-plugin/marketplace.json   ← marketplace catalog (this file is what /plugin marketplace add reads)
├── plugins/
│   └── docks/                         ← the plugin itself (only this gets cached on user install)
│       ├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json

│       └── README.md                  ← plugin-facing docs

```

**What ships to users**: only `plugins/docks/`. Files at the repo root (`scripts/`, `.github/`, this `README.md`, `LICENSE`) stay in the marketplace repo for development + CI but are NOT copied to `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` on install. This is enforced by the marketplace `source` boundary, not by an ignore-file mechanism — Claude Code's plugin cache copies only the directory pointed at by `source`.

## Develop locally

Test changes without pushing to GitHub:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./plugins/docks
```

When a `--plugin-dir` plugin shares a name with an installed marketplace plugin, the local copy wins for that session.

After edits, run `/reload-plugins` in the running session — no Claude Code restart needed.

## Validate before pushing

Six validators mirror the kit-side conventions:

```bash
bash scripts/guard-skills.sh     # structural — frontmatter, ≤500 lines, name-matches-dir
bash scripts/score-skills.sh     # quality score (max 16) — Use-when prefix, freshness, BAD/GOOD ratio
bash scripts/guard-commands.sh   # subagent_type cross-refs resolve to plugins/docks/agents/*.md
bash scripts/score-commands.sh   # quality score (max 20) — Plan Mode, Phase Transition, slop
bash scripts/guard-agents.sh     # frontmatter, "Use when…" / "Not…" CSO, model declared
bash scripts/score-agents.sh     # quality score (max 15) — model, tools, Workflow + Success Criteria
```

`--per-file` flag on score scripts prints one `<name> <score>` line per item — useful for spotting drift after an edit.

CI runs all six on every push to `main` and every PR (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Versioning

`version` in `marketplace.json` and `plugins/docks/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` controls update propagation:

- **With explicit version**: users only receive updates when this field bumps. Bump on every release.
- **Without version**: the git commit SHA is used; every commit counts as a new version (noisier but auto-tracking).

Use `claude plugin tag` (from inside `plugins/docks/`) to cut a tagged release after bumping.

## License

MIT — see `LICENSE` at the repo root.
